I have multiple React files (components, pages, services, hooks, CSS) in my project. I want to refactor and improve them to be:

1. Clean, modular, and maintainable (components handle only UI, services handle API calls).
2. Shorter and readable using best practices (use ternary operators, optional chaining, .filter(Boolean), memoization where needed).
3. Reusable (custom hooks for repeated logic like fetching, state management).
4. Error-proof (handle null/undefined safely, protect against backend changes).
5. Performance-optimized (useMemo/useCallback where needed, avoid unnecessary renders).
6. Ready for testing (unit tests for services, component tests for pages/components).

Analyze all the files I provide, point out problems, suggest improvements, and optionally rewrite the code in the improved version following these rules.
